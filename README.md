## Build
You need : 
* [devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

If you want to build .cia, then you also need : 
* [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases) and [makerom](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases) (Copy them in your path e.g. in `{devkitPro_install_dir}\tools\bin`).

If you already have devkitpro, type `{devkitPro_install_dir}\devkitARM\bin\arm-none-eabi-gcc -v`. \
You should see something like : 
```
.....
.....
.....
Thread model: posix
Supported LTO compression algorithms: zlib zstd
gcc version 13.2.0 (devkitARM release 62)
```
Make sure you have release 62. \
(later version may work but sometimes later version has incompatibility) \
If you have older devkitpro, update it or compilation will fail.

* Clone this repository
  * On windows run `build.bat`
  * On other system, type `make` (`make -j` for faster build)
